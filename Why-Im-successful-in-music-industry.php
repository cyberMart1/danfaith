                 <p class="lorem_text">
                    <p>Nigerian singer, Simisola Kosoko, popularly known as Simi, has revealed the reason for her success.</p>
                    <p>
                        The mother of one acknowledged that the sacrifices of the female artistes who held sway before her played a vital role in her success in the music industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She noted that those workaholic women shattered the status quo and paved the way for other women to succeed in the male-dominated industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During a recent conversation with African Folder, Simi said: “There are women who have worked hard to damn the status quo.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “So, I won’t give myself much credit than for because I also benefitted from other women who came before me.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Simi began her career as a gospel artiste before making the switch to secular music in 2014.

                    <p>
                        In an interview she granted a few years ago, Simi stated that she dumped gospel music because it wasn’t “lucrative.”
