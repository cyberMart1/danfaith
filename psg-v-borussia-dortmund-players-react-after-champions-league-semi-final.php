                        “The belief was there. We spoke about the game against Eindhoven (Dortmund’s last-16 tie) how short the road to London is. It’ll take us a bit of time to realise that, but we’re looking forward to it very much.”

                        “Today it was clear that we needed to suffer, that we needed some luck, but what the lads did, crazy, crazy.”

                        “Jule (Brandt) served it nicely on my head. Of course we’ll be happy to take it. I haven’t scored many goals in the Champions League. I think five. A good time to stock up.”

                        “We will face a very strong opponent. We all believe in it. We have believed since the second game in the group phase at the latest that we can survive in the Champions League”

                        “We didn’t score the goals. They scored two goals, one from a corner and another from deep (in the first leg)… The fans were wonderful and we wanted to go all the way to Wembley with them.”
