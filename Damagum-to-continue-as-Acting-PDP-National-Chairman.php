                        <h2 class="most_text">Damagum to continue as Acting PDP National Chairman</h2>
                    <p class="bold">
                        The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged Alhaji Umar Damagum, to continue as the Acting National Chairman of the party, pending the election of a new chairman in August.

                    <p>
                        The chairman of the PDP Governors Forum and Governor of Bauchi State, Bala Mohammed, said this when he briefed newsmen shortly after the 98th NEC meeting of the party on Thursday in Abuja.

                        “In the next two months we will see a lot of activities; leadership is a responsibility. We said in September that we would have come out from our congresses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “We will look at the issue of leadership and look at the issue of our constitution where it will be and we will do it without rancour,” he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bala added that the successful conduct of the party’s NEC meeting was an indication that there was no dissension and rancour within the leadership.

                    <p>
                        “It was planned that the party will have an explosion. PDP is more than that, we have gone beyond that. This party is united and we are guided by experience and constitutionality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “There were a lot of permutations and mischievous thinking outside there. But we looked at all the issues and we worked along our guidelines and constitution. There is no problem or dissension and problem among members,” he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also speaking, Damagum said that the leadership of the party was not a do or die affair.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “This is not a matter of life and death. I am still an elected member of this NEC. Even if I revert to deputy national chairman I’m still a member of NWC. The issue of surviving or not does not emerge,” he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr Debo Ologunagba said that issue of the party leadership would be considered in August.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Our party emphasises the need for reconciliation and stability within the party at this time. Therefore, the issue of the National Chairman, Damagum, has been deferred to the next NEC meeting, which is tentatively scheduled for Aug. 15,” he said.
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        Ologunagba later read the communique of the meeting, saying that the NEC tasked all organs, leaders, stakeholders and members of the PDP to close ranks and put aside their differences and work together to reposition and return the PDP to power.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        He said that the NEC also received and approved the timetable for the party’s congresses across the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “NEC also approved the Reconstitution of the Party Disciplinary and Reconciliation Committees to further ensure the stability of the Party.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Similarly, NEC approved the extension of the life of the Party Constitution Amendment Committee to allow it to receive new amendment proposals for inclusion in its deliberation and final report for consideration by NEC.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “NEC commended the efforts of the National Working Committee in its effort towards rebranding the Party including the new look PDP Logo which is widely accepted by Party members and Nigerians in general.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “NEC charges all Party members to continue to work together for the success of the PDP for the benefit of Nigerians and sustenance of Democracy in our country,” he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ologunagba said that the NEC advised President Bola Tinubu to convene a special National Security Council meeting to proffer a holistic solution to the current security challenge facing the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He said that the NEC also urged Tinubu to rejig his economic team to include individuals with proven integrity and competence to assist in repositioning the economy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “NEC further demands that the Federal Government should review all policies and programmes which are stifling the economy with suffocating effect on the lives of citizens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “These include the increase in price of fuel without cushioning measures, hike in electricity tariff, increased taxation and implementation of adverse fiscal policies,” he said.
