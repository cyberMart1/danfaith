                        Several women have alleged that they were raped by members of the police who used plastic
                      bags often used to sell water in little packages in Nigeria as condoms.

                            by officers of the Nigerian police in Abuja, Agbuegbo and her friend were stopped. 
                            Agwuegbo’s friend, who was driving at the time, was wearing a short skirt with her 
                            thighs exposed and was forced to get out to open the trunk of her car.
                        </p>
                        <p dir="ltr">“Because she was exposed, I immediately came down to open the trunk of 
                            the car because I had longer shorts, but the police told me to get back into the 
                            car,” Agwuegbo tells <em>TRT World.</em> Thankfully that was one of the milder

                            carried out in 2011, it found that many policemen use the threat of rape and other forms of sexual assault 
                            to extort money from women, particularly at checkpoints, in public spaces or those in police custody.

                        <p dir="ltr">In 2012, Nigerian actress Dorothy Njemanze was arrested with three other women by officers of 
                            the same task force and accused of being a prostitute. Despite her arrest, she was never charged. 
                            But in a high-profile case, Njemanze took the Nigerian government to court and in October of 2017, 
                            the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) court ruled in her favour, ordering the Nigerian

                            <p dir="ltr">“But as a woman in Nigeria, even around law enforcement, there is a serious fear of being 
                                sexually molested,” Agwuegbo says.</p><p dir="ltr">After the arrests of the women, protests were 
                                    quickly organised via Twitter and people organised in various cities including 
                                    <a href="https://mail.trtworld.com/owa/redir.aspx?REF=UQBTRJCiR3XErPeggV7Su5CXA-aTlM9wZsHXhjAv3wyDFzBzxf_WCAFodHRwczovL3RoZW5hdGl2ZW1hZy5jb20vY29tbXVuaXRpZXMvc2NlbmVzLXVrLXByb3Rlc3Qtc3RvcC1hYnVqYS1wb2xpY2UtcmFpZC13b21lbi8.">Lagos, Abuja, Accra in Ghana and in the United Kingdom</a>.

                                <p dir="ltr">“As huge as the gaps in policing in Nigeria are, there is a bigger problem of sexual 
                                    harassment in Nigeria and at the moment, it does not seem like a priority for the Nigerian government,”
                                     Ayodeji Osowobi explains. Osowobi is the founder of Stand to End Rape, a non-profit established in 
                                     2014 to bring forward conversations about sexual rights in Nigeria.

                                        workplace for women in Nigeria,” Osowobi tells <em>TRT World.&nbsp;</em>Her non-profit was one of 
                                        the major players in the protests organised to get justice for the arrested women.
                                    </p>
                                    <p dir="ltr">During the planning stage of the protests, the organising groups reached out to inform 
                                        the police of their protest and to get a security detail, but the response given to them was that 
                                        the police would not guarantee their safety during the protests.

                                        Moula explains.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of the protest, she filed an official complaint to the 
                                            police, but until today does not know how the case ended. “I got a couple of calls from officers 
                                            of the police and eventually the man apologising, but I was not told any action had been taken 
                                            against him,” Moula says.</p><p dir="ltr">The protests and their subsequent coverage, however, 
                                                did not do anything to bring about any change or discussions with regard to policy. Instead, 
                                                non-profits and people on social media are taking a different approach towards the next

                                            <p dir="ltr">With a network of volunteers across Nigeria and even extending to South Africa and a few West 
                                                African cities, Ganikale is looking to change the status quo on how Africans see and interact with sex.
                                                 “I believe [that] if children and young people are made to understand what consent is, there will be a

                                                 explains.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">However, as a largely conservative country it is unlikely that 
                                                    conversations about sex and harassment in Nigeria will be brought up on a national scale. Several 
                                                    older Nigerians including religious leaders believe that it is the proliferation of Western ideas 
                                                    that have led to incidences of rape and harassment in the country.&nbsp;

                                                <p dir="ltr">Nigerian comedian and actor Ime Bishop Umoh released videos on his social media accounts 
                                                    asserting that the women allegedly raped by the police were not raped but stolen from. He argued 
                                                    that they could not have been raped because they are “selling themselves”.
