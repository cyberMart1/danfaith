                        </h2>
                    <p class="bold">
                        The Presidency has announced that President Bola Tinubu and his aides will return to Nigeria from Europe today.                                              
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recall that the President travelled for a meeting with the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, over two weeks ago, from where he took a trip to Saudi Arabia to attend a special World Economic Forum, WEF.
                        <br><br>
                        He subsequently travelled to Europe after the summit
                        <br><br>
                        Special Adviser to the President on Information and Strategy, Bayo Onanuga, who announced the development in a post on his X handle yesterday, said: “President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, along with his aides, will return to Nigeria tomorrow (today) from Europe.”

                    <p>
                        On April 22, Tinubu left Abuja, the country’s capital, for the Kingdom of The Netherlands on an official visit.
                        <br><br>
                        Ajuri Ngelale, presidential spokesperson, said the president was visiting The Netherlands at the invitation of Prime Minister Mark Rutte.
                        <br><br>
                        After the engagements in The Netherlands, Tinubu proceeded to Riyadh in Saudi Arabia to attend a special World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting between April 28 and 29.
                        <br><br>
                        The president was expected back in the country after the forum in Saudi Arabia, but he did not return, which fueled speculations about his whereabouts.
                        <br><br>
                        Some reports said the president travelled to London from Saudi Arabia for a private visit before heading to France, a European country.
