                     <h2 class="most_text">Mauricio Pochettino exclusive: Chelsea progress important but we want European football</h2>
   
                     <p class="lorem_text">
                        <p><strong>"Both." A bullish Mauricio Pochettino was quick to answer when posed the question of whether European qualification or signs of progress in his team is more important to Chelsea as we reach the business end of the season.</strong>                           
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           It has not been the easiest of seasons for Chelsea. After a significant summer spend, progress at Stamford Bridge has been slower than expected.

                           Despite an inconsistent season, Chelsea have the chance to finish on a high. An FA Cup semi-final against Man City is fast approaching and the Blues have also propelled themselves into the race for Europe in recent weeks in the Premier League

                        <p>
                           Unbeaten in seven league games, Chelsea currently sit ninth, five points behind six-placed Manchester United and with games in hand over many of the sides above them, including Erik ten Hag's side.

                           In recent weeks, Tottenham head coach Ange Postecoglou has been firm in saying establishing his style of play and seeing improvement from his team is the priority over worrying about the chase for Champions League qualification.

                        <p>
                           The Chelsea project is also still in its infancy and while Pochettino, who has been in position at Chelsea for nine months, acknowledges the importance of his side's journey and the improvements that need to be made, he's targeting a strong end to the season and European football for next season.
