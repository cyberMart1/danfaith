                        A circular issued by the CBN, yesterday, directed the deductions would become effective from the next two weeks.
                        <br><br>
                        The circular, issued by the Director of Payment Services, Uzoma Efobi, was addressed to all  banks and payments services operators in the country.
                        <br><br>
                        According to the CBN, the deductions shall be applied at the transaction origination.

                        They will be put together and paid into the Cybersecurity Fund held by the CBN.

                        However, interbank transfers and loans transactions were exemted from the CBN cybersecurity levy.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Act</strong><br>
                        The circular was a follow-up on an earlier letter dated June 25, 2018 (Ref: BPS/DIR/GEN/CIR/05/008), and October 5, 2018 (Ref: BSD/DIR/GEN/LAB/11/023), on compliance with the Cybercrimes (Prohibition, Prevention, Etc.) Act 2015.
                        <br><br>
                        It noted that “Following the enactment of the Cybercrime (Prohibition, Prevention, etc) (amendment) Act 2024 and under the provision of Section 44 (2)(a) of the Act, a levy of 0.5 per cent (0.005) equivalent to a half per cent of all electronic transactions value by the business specified in the Second Schedule of the Act, is to be remitted to the National Cybersecurity Fund which shall be administered by the Office of the National Security Adviser.”
                        <br><br>
                        Also, CBN stressed that “The deducted amount shall be reflected in the customer’s account with the narration, ‘Cybersecurity Levy’.”
                        <br><br>
                        Meanwhile, just barely a week ago, the Federal Government implemented deduction of ‘Stamp Duty’.
