                    <p class="bold">
                        Sofyan Amrabat will be looking for a new club this summer with Manchester United not 
                        intending to make his loan move permanent, according to reports.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Amrabat joined Man Utd on loan with buy option</li>
                        <li>Red Devils disappointed with midfielder</li>
                        <li>No plans to extend stay at Old Trafford</li>

                        <h1>WHAT HAPPENED?</h1>
                        The Morocco midfielder has been a forgotten face in the Premier League this season 
                        after making just two starts for Manchester United in the top flight. His loan move 
                        was highly anticipated after impressing for his country at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar 
                        but the 27-year-old has fallen short of expectations.

                        <h1>THE BIGGER PICTURE</h1>
                        United's recruitment has been below par in recent years and Amrabat is one of many 
                        big-name signings who have failed to deliver. Alongside Antony, Mason Mount and Rasmus 
                        Hojlund, the former Fiorentina anchor has struggled to get fans on side with his lack 
                        of quality on the pitch.

                    <p>
                        <h1>WHAT THE REPORTS SAID</h1>
                        While the Premier League giants are not expected to bring Amrabat back to Manchester, 
                        he will likely be heading to a new club, with Tuttosport reporting that Fiorentina wish
                         to cash in on the 56-cap international. Before his initial move to United, plenty of 
                         teams were sniffing around the midfielder and could return for a second look if the 
                         price is right.

                        <h1>WHAT NEXT FOR AMRABAT?</h1>
                        The news outlet suggests that AC Milan are monitoring the former Dutch Cup winner and 
                        have 'taken the first steps' to bring him to the San Siro. Amrabat's agency SEG also 
                        manages Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijnders and they are trying to push a deal through 
                        for between â‚¬15-18million.
